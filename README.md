## 🎯 Project Overview

**CORTEX** (Cognitive Operations & Reasoning Technology EXpert) is a comprehensive, privacy-first AI assistant ecosystem designed specifically for developers and students. The system features four tightly integrated components that work together to provide an intelligent, voice-controlled development environment.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **🔐 Privacy-First**: All AI processing happens locally - no data leaves your machine
- **🎤 Voice Control**: Natural language commands with "Hey CORTEX" activation
- **👋 Gesture Recognition**: Hand gesture control using computer vision
- **🧠 Learning AI**: Adapts to your coding patterns and preferences
- **📚 Educational Focus**: Built-in learning paths and skill development tracking
- **⚡ Hardware Optimized**: Specifically tuned for common developer hardware (i7-1355U, 8-16GB RAM)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The CORTEX ecosystem consists of four core components:

### 1. **SentinelDB** - Secure Vector Database

- Encrypted local storage for all user data
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
- Real-time data synchronization
- Backup and recovery systems

### 2. **Cerebro Shell** - Voice & Command Interface

- Voice recognition and processing
- Natural language understanding
- Gesture recognition via MediaPipe
- Command routing and execution

### 3. **CORTEX Core** - AI Processing Engine

- Local LLM inference (LLaMA 3, CodeLLaMA)
- Context management and memory
- Intent classification and response generation
- Learning and adaptation algorithms

### 4. **Codexa IDE** - Integrated Development Environment

- AI-powered code completion
- Real-time code analysis
- Collaborative features
- Multi-language support
